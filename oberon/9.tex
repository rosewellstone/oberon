\chapter{Device Driver(DD)}
\label{ch:DD}
\section{Overview}
DDs are collections of procedures that constitute the immediate interface between hardware
and software. They refer to those parts of the computer hardware that are usually called
\emph{peripheral}. Computers typically contain a system bus which transmits data among its
different parts. Processor and memory are considered as its internal parts; the remaining
parts, such as disk, keyboard, display, etc, are considered as external or peripheral,
notwithstanding the fact that they are often contained in the same cabinet or board.

Such peripheral devices are connected to the system bus via special registers (data buffers)
and transceivers (switches, buffers in the sense of digital electronics). These registers
and transceivers are addressed by the processor in the same way as memory locations - they
are said to be \emph{memory-mapped} - and they constitute the hardware interface between
processor bus and device. References to them are typically confined to specific driver
procedures which constitute the software interface.

Drivers are inherently hardware specific, and the justification of their existence is precisely
that they encapsulate these specifics and present to their clients an appropriate abstraction
of the device. Evidently, this abstraction must still reflect the essential characteristics
of the device, but not the details (e.g. the addresses of its interface registers).

Our justification to present the drivers connecting the Oberon with the RISC computer in
detail is on the one hand the desire for completeness. But on the other hand it is also in
recognition of the fact that their design represents an essential part of the engineering
task in building a system. This part may look trivial from a conceptual point of view; it
certainly is not so in practice. In order to reduce the number of interface types, standards
have been established. The RISC computer also uses such interface standards, and we will
concentrate on them in the following presentations.

The following devices are presented:
\begin{description}
  \item[Keyboard] Considered as a serial device delivering one byte of input data per key
    stroke. It is connected by a serial line according to the PS/2 and ASCII standards.
    The software is contained in module \verb|Input| (\ref{sec:kbm}), and the hardware is
    explained in \ref{sub:ps2}.
  \item[Mouse] A pointing device delivering coordinates as well as key states. The software
    is also part of \verb|Input| (\ref{sec:kbm}).
  \item[Display] The interface to it is an area of memory contains the displayed information,
    exactly one bit per pixel for a monochrome display. This area is called \emph{frame buffer}
    or bitmap. Here the size of the display area is 768 lines and 1024 dots per line,
    representing a raster. The software is module \verb|Display|, which primarily consists
    of operations to draw frequently occurring patterns (called \emph{raster-ops}, explained
    in \ref{sec:raster-ops}). The actual display requires a hardware interface called a
    \emph{display controller}, the connection between which and the display follows the
    VGA-Standard (see \ref{sub:dispctrl}).
  \item[Disk] Our RISC computer does not use a magnetic, rotating disk to store non-volatile
    data. Instead, it uses an SD-card (flash-RAM). The driver is contained in module
    \verb|Kernel| (\ref{sec:kernel}). The hardware is discussed in \ref{sub:spi}.
  \item[Net] In the original text, a network was presented consisting of a bus connecting
    many computers, based on the RS-485 standard. It was implemented by the serial communications
    controller Zilog 8530, operating at a frequency of 230 Kb/s. The name SCC has been retained
    as a generic interface, behind which the packet transport has now been re-implemented
    as a simple wireless network (Nordic nRF24L01 controller) in the regulation-free 2.4GHz
    industrial/scientific/medical (ISM) frequency band.
\end{description}
In all driver modules the implementation-dependent procedures \verb|SYSTEM.PUT|, \verb|SYSTEM.GET|,
and \verb|SYSTEM.BIT| are used to access the registers of the device interface. Their 1st
parameter is the address of the register, the 2nd an expression or variable.

\section{Keyboard and mouse}
\label{sec:kbm}
Their driver procedures are in \verb|Input|. \verb|Available() > 0| signals that a
character has been typed on the keyboard. The character is read by calling \verb|Read(c)|.
\verb|Input| is restricting the data to the ASCII character set Latin-1, i.e. the values
lie in the range $0X \le c < 80X$ (7-bit values). \verb|Mouse(keys, x, y)| yields the
current keys state and coordinates of the mouse.
\begin{verbatim}
  MODULE Input;
    PROC Available(): INT;
    PROC Read(VAR c: CHAR);
    PROC Mouse(VAR keys: SET; VAR x, y: INT);
    PROC SetMouseLimits(w, h: INT);
    PROC Init;
  END Input.
\end{verbatim}
The driver software accesses the keyboard via the Standard PS/2 interface represented by
an 8-bit register for the received data \verb|kbdCode|, and a single-bit flag indicating
whether a byte had been received.

The keyboard codes received from the keyboard via a PS/2 line are not identical with the
character values delivered to the \verb|Read| procedure. A conversion is necessary. This
is so, because modern keyboards treat all keys in the same way, including the ones for
upper case, control, alternative, etc. Separate codes are sent to signal the pushing down
and the release of a key, followed by another code identifying which key had been pressed
or released. This requires, besides a translation table from codes to characters, a set of
state variables. They are the global, boolean variables \verb|Recd|, \verb|Up|, \verb|Shift|,
\verb|Ctrl|, and \verb|Ext|. Procedure \verb|Peek| determines whether an actual character
is present, or merely a code signalling a key shift. \verb|Peek| controls the state.

Procedure \verb|Mouse| fetches a word from the mouse interface register and decomposes it
into its components (keys state and coordinates). (\verb|kb| is the bit indicating whether
a code had been received from the keyboard).

\section{The SD-card (disk)}
SD-card are high-volume memory devices based on flash-store technology. They are typically
organized as individually accessible blocks of 1K bytes. The driver for the SD-card is
contained in module \verb|Kernel|, which also handles allocation and reservation of blocks,
here in analogy to rotating disks still called \emph{sectors}.
\begin{verbatim}
  TYPE Sector = ARRAY SectorLength OF BYTE;
  PROC GetSector(src: INT; VAR dst: Sector);
  PROC PutSector(dst: INT; VAR src: Sector);
  PROC AllocSector(hint: INT; VAR sec: INT);
  PROC MarkSector(sec: INT);
  PROC FreeSector(sec: INT);
\end{verbatim}
Data transfer is sequential and handled by procedures \verb|ReadSD| and \verb|WriteSD| by
issuing commands. These are for transmitting a block address, for receiving, and for sending
a block of data. Synchronous transmission of sequences of words follows the SPI standard,
which uses 3 lines, one for data input, one for data output, and one for the clock (see also
\ref{sub:spi}). The hardware interface contains a 32-bit register. The bit-rate is 8.3 MB/s.

\section{Serial asynchronous interface (RS 232)}
The RS-232 standard serves to transmit sequences of bytes over a data line asynchronously.
This implies that there is no separate clock line (see also \ref{sub:rs232}). The hardware
interface contains a 10-bit register for the transmitter and one for the receiver. The data rate
used here is 19,200 bit/s. A byte is sent and received over the line by the following programs.
\begin{verbatim}
  CONST data = -56;
        stat = -52; (*device register addresses*)
  PROC Send(x: BYTE);
  BEGIN
    REPEAT UNTIL SYSTEM.BIT(stat, 1);
    SYSTEM.PUT(data, x)
  END Send;

  PROC Rec(VAR x: BYTE);
  BEGIN
    REPEAT UNTIL SYSTEM.BIT(stat, 0);
    SYSTEM.GET(data, x)
  END Rec;
\end{verbatim}
These procedures are used in the driver module RS232 presented in \ref{sec:datalink}. This
module itself is not used in the Oberon core, but it was instrumental in building the System
on a host computer and downloading it. It is characterized by a very simple interface.

\section{Serial communications controller (SCC)}
The interface of the driver for the network was taken over from the original design using
a serial communocations controller Zilog 8530. The implementation changed totally. It was
designed by Paul Reed for the wireless controller Nordic nRF24L01.
\begin{verbatim}
  DEFINITION SCC;
    TYPE Header = RECORD valid: BOOL;
                    dadr, sadr, typ: BYTE;
                    len: INT; (*of data following header*)
                  END;
    PROC Start(filter: BOOL);
    PROC Send(VAR head: Header; buf: ARRAY OF BYTE);
    PROC Available(): INT;
    PROC ReceiveHead(VAR head: Header);
    PROC Receive(VAR x: BYTE);
    PROC Skip(m: INT);
    PROC Stop;
  END SCC.
\end{verbatim}
